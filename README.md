# 🧠 CatIQz — Market Event Intelligence Platform

**CatIQz** is an early-stage personal project that helps traders, analysts, and investors detect **market-moving catalysts** in real time.  
It automatically collects, summarises, and analyses global events — like macroeconomic shifts, corporate news, and geopolitical developments — to surface insights before markets react.

## 🚀 Overview

📰 **Fetches live news** from multiple open APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub)  
🤖 **Summarises and analyses** events using an AI model (Hugging Face)  
💾 **Stores insights** (headline, summary, timestamp, sentiment) in a structured database (Supabase)  
📊 **Displays a live dashboard** showing key catalysts, sectors, and trends  

In short:  
> **CatIQz reads world news → summarises it with AI → turns it into actionable market intelligence.**

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As an options trader, I often missed early catalysts that moved the market — by the time I saw the news, the price had already reacted.  
So I started building **CatIQz** to **automate my own research workflow**, using AI to surface relevant global events faster and more intelligently.

This project has helped me:
- Learn end-to-end full-stack development and deployment  
- Work with NLP and summarisation models  
- Handle real-time API integrations and data structuring  
- Understand how to transform unstructured information into insights
